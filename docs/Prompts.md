You are my coding agent. First, read every file I attach completely (as fully as possible) and treat them as the source of truth.

Now complete PHASE 1 — Repository & Engineering Baseline for my NestJS + TypeScript project PortfoRadar. Do only this phase (don’t implement future phases unless the current phase explicitly requires it).

Goals: implement the phase correctly and cleanly, like a careful human engineer would. Code should be production-lean, understandable, and easy for me to maintain (avoid unnecessary complexity, but don’t oversimplify correctness).

Constraints:

Follow the attached phase plan; if files conflict, prefer the newest/most specific instruction in the attachments.

Use NestJS CLI defaults (CommonJS, don’t set "type": "module").

Add only dependencies needed for the current phase.

Do not commit—I will commit.

Output format:

Key takeaways from the attached files (3–6 bullets)

Exact commands you ran

File tree (top 2 levels)

For each file you created/edited: what changed + full contents

Verification steps (commands + expected results)

Suggested commit message (only; don’t commit)

Stop after completing this phase.
