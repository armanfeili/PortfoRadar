You are my coding agent. First, read every file I attach completely (as fully as possible) and treat them as the source of truth.

Now complete PHASE 1 — Repository & Engineering Baseline for my NestJS + TypeScript project PortfoRadar. Do only this phase (don’t implement future phases unless the current phase explicitly requires it).

Goals: implement the phase correctly and cleanly, like a careful human engineer would. Code should be production-lean, understandable, and easy for me to maintain (avoid unnecessary complexity, but don’t oversimplify correctness).

Constraints:

Follow the attached phase plan; if files conflict, prefer the newest/most specific instruction in the attachments.

Use NestJS CLI defaults (CommonJS, don’t set "type": "module").

Add only dependencies needed for the current phase.

Do not commit—I will commit.

Output format:

Key takeaways from the attached files (3–6 bullets)

Exact commands you ran

File tree (top 2 levels)

For each file you created/edited: what changed + full contents

Verification steps (commands + expected results)

Suggested commit message (only; don’t commit)

Stop after completing this phase.

You are my coding agent. First, read every file I attach completely (as fully as possible) and treat them as the source of truth for requirements and current state.

Project: PortfoRadar (NestJS + TypeScript, CommonJS; Nest CLI defaults; no "type": "module").

8.X = 8.8

Target work:
Now complete **PHASE 8.X — <TITLE>** from the attached `DEVELOPMENT_PHASES.md`.
- IMPORTANT: Do ONLY this sub-phase (8.X). Do NOT implement other Phase 8 items (8.Y) or any future phases unless 8.X explicitly requires it.
- If `DEVELOPMENT_PHASES.md` says part of 8.X is "Already done", verify it in the codebase and focus only on the "Remaining enhancements".
- If files conflict, prefer the newest/most specific instruction in the attachments.

Engineering goals:
- Implement the phase correctly and cleanly like a careful human engineer.
- Keep changes production-lean, maintainable, and consistent with existing patterns.
- Add ONLY dependencies needed for this sub-phase.
- Avoid any breaking API changes unless the sub-phase explicitly asks for it; if unavoidable, update docs and keep backward compatibility where reasonable.

Operational constraints:
- Use NestJS CLI defaults (CommonJS). Keep existing project structure.
- Do not commit — I will commit.
- If a task requires external accounts/secrets (e.g., GHCR/DockerHub/Railway tokens), implement everything possible in code + docs + CI using placeholders, and clearly list what I must do manually (without guessing secrets).

Process (do this explicitly):
1) Locate the exact section for **8.X** in `DEVELOPMENT_PHASES.md`, and extract its checklist items (“Already done” + “Remaining enhancements”).
2) Inspect the repository to determine what’s already implemented vs missing for 8.X.
3) Implement all missing items for 8.X end-to-end.
4) Run the smallest set of verification commands that convincingly prove 8.X is complete (lint/test/build/start/curl as appropriate).
5) Update documentation where needed (README and/or docs/ files) to reflect the new capability.

Output format (MANDATORY):
- Key takeaways from the attached files (3–6 bullets)
- Exact commands you ran
- File tree (top 2 levels)
- For each file you created/edited: what changed + full contents
- Verification steps (commands + expected results)
- Suggested commit message (only; don’t commit)
- Stop after completing this phase.
