Code Challenge

>_ Goal  
Build an application that retrieves all portfolio companies of the Portfolio of KKR General Partner.  
This is the website: KKR.  
https://www.kkr.com/  
https://www.kkr.com/invest/portfolio

The basic set of information we are looking for are:  
- portfolio company name  
- asset class  
- industry  
- region distribution  

There might be more information per company—try to get them as well.

>_ Requirements  
Basic Solution:  
  - The application should be able to retrieve the basic set of information.

Advanced Solution:  
  - Get as much information as possible per company.  
  - Develop an application to query and use/show the data.  
  - The application could use a CLI or any preferred UI.  
  - Results should be written into a database.  
  - You can use any programming language or framework, but the preferred stack is suggested.

>_ Preferred Technology Stack  
NodeJS  
TypeScript (NestJS framework)  
MongoDB

The Berry Code Challenge
=======================

1) What this challenge is
-------------------------
You have to build an application that collects (retrieves) the portfolio companies that appear under the “Portfolio of KKR General Partner” on KKR’s website, and then stores the results into a database in a clean, structured way.

Target website/pages:
- https://www.kkr.com/
- https://www.kkr.com/invest/portfolio

2) Core goal (what you must retrieve)
-------------------------------------
For each portfolio company, the “basic set of information” you must capture is:
- Company name
- Asset class
- Industry
- Region distribution

Important:
- The site may contain more data per company. You should try to collect additional fields too, if available.

3) Two target solution levels
-----------------------------

A) Basic Solution (minimum expected)
- Retrieve the basic set of information for all portfolio companies.
- Save the data into a database.
- Data must be saved in a “well-structured data format”.
- You must design a data model (i.e., decide what collections/tables and fields exist, and how they relate).

What “well-structured” implies:
- Consistent field names and types
- A clear schema / document structure (even in MongoDB)
- Avoid duplicated or messy data (e.g., normalized references or consistent embedded docs)

B) Advanced Solution (stronger submission)
- Retrieve as much information as possible per company (beyond the basic fields).
- Build an application that allows querying and using/showing the retrieved data.
- Interaction can be via:
  - CLI (Command Line Interface), or
  - UI (any preferred UI), or
  - API (often REST is a good fit)

Still required:
- The results must be written into a database.

4) Preferred technology stack
-----------------------------
They prefer (and strongly suggest) using:
- NodeJS
- TypeScript (NestJS framework)
- MongoDB

Notes:
- You are allowed to use any language/framework you are comfortable with.
- However, using their stack often improves alignment with their expectations and evaluation.

5) “Production ready” expectations (what they likely mean)
----------------------------------------------------------
Your code should look like something that could be maintained and run reliably, not a quick script.

Common “production-ready” characteristics:
- Clear project structure (modules/services, separation of concerns)
- Reliable data retrieval (handles pagination, retries, timeouts, and changes gracefully)
- Input validation and good error handling (no silent failures)
- Logging (useful logs, not random console spam)
- Configuration via environment variables (not hard-coded secrets/URLs)
- Reproducible runs (can run twice without duplicating junk data)
- Documented setup and usage (README)

Guideline they explicitly state:
- Do not try to implement every possible “bonus” if you’re not comfortable.
- Better to implement fewer features well than many features poorly.

6) Data retrieval scope (what you should think about)
-----------------------------------------------------
You need to retrieve “all portfolio companies” shown under the relevant portfolio category.

Typical web-data considerations (likely relevant):
- Pagination / “Load more” behavior
- Filtering facets (asset class, industry, geography)
- Dynamic rendering (some data might load via API calls in the background)
- Company detail pages (sometimes extra data lives there)
- Data consistency (same company might appear under multiple filters/views)

A robust approach usually:
- Identifies the real data source (often JSON API calls behind the page)
- Extracts structured data from that source instead of fragile HTML scraping
- Enforces an idempotent load strategy (upsert by unique key)

7) Database requirement (what you must deliver)
------------------------------------------------
You must store results in a DB, and the storage must reflect a designed data model.

Typical MongoDB design approach:
- Collection: companies
  - Fields: name, slug/id, assetClass, industry, regions, etc.
  - Additional details: website, description, headquarters, ownership dates, etc. (if available)
- Possibly additional collections if needed:
  - runs / ingestion_logs (track when a crawl ran and what changed)
  - metadata (source URLs, last fetched time, versioning)

Key requirement:
- The data format must be well-structured.
- That means you should define a consistent schema (even if Mongo is schemaless).

8) Query / usage requirement (advanced solution)
------------------------------------------------
If you do the advanced solution, you also deliver a way to query and show the data.

Examples of “query and show” interfaces:
- REST API endpoints:
  - GET /companies
  - GET /companies/:id
  - GET /companies?assetClass=...&industry=...&region=...
- CLI commands:
  - fetch (ingest data)
  - list (list companies)
  - search (filter by asset class/industry/region)
- Simple UI:
  - Table view + filters + company detail modal/page

9) Evaluation criteria (how they will judge you)
------------------------------------------------

A) Presentation
- Clear documentation that explains how to run the app.
- Typically includes a README with steps, prerequisites, and examples.

B) Ease of Execution
- How easy it is to start from your documentation and run successfully.
- Fewer manual steps and fewer assumptions help.

C) Execution Result
- Did you actually satisfy the requirements?
- Did you retrieve “all companies” and store correct fields?
- Advanced: can you query and display the stored data?

D) Code Quality
They evaluate:
- Cleanliness
- Conciseness vs verbosity balance
- Structure (folders/modules/classes)
- Naming
- Correct and effective language usage
- Warning/error handling
- Linting quality

E) Application Architecture
They want:
- Multiple files/classes with responsibility separation
- Decoupling between functions/classes
- Use of design patterns where appropriate (not forced)

F) Version Control
They evaluate:
- Using Git (or another VCS)
- Effective commit history and messages
- Proper file exclusions (e.g., node_modules, .env, build output)

10) Bonus items (optional, extra points)
----------------------------------------
These are “nice-to-have” and can increase your score if done well:

- UX
  Quality of interaction with the app (API/CLI/UI/DB console usability)

- Linter
  Use ESLint/Prettier (or equivalent) to maintain consistent style and catch issues

- Container
  Dockerize the app, and push image to a registry

- Configuration Management
  Use environment variables/config files
  Avoid hard-coded variables
  Manage secrets properly

- Deployment
  Deploy online so it works remotely (cloud VM, container platform, etc.)

- Tests
  Automated tests, good coverage, meaningful assertions

- CI/CD
  Pipeline that runs tests/lint/build automatically (e.g., GitHub Actions)

- Delivery Time
  Reference: 1 week, adjusted to candidate experience

- AI integration
  Using AI is allowed and encouraged, BUT:
  If you include generated code you don’t understand (errors/poor understanding),
  it will negatively impact evaluation.

11) Confidentiality note (must respect)
